[color=purple][b][size=10pt]Change Log[/size][/b][/color]
[size=8pt]
[b]Version 1.0.1 - May 16 2018[/b]
! Play nicely with maps! (iFrames should be limited at 100% max-width for mobile devices)
! Login & Search (top) buttons/inputs should be bigger now.
! Give more space to post... none likes to stay too close (Posts (.inner) has more padding now)
! Margin of buttons now controlled by almighty parent li... (On buttonlist, a element has 0 margin and all spacing handled by upper li element)
! Structure changes means we don't have to show this also saves space for actual topic title (Author text on topic display now hidden by default)
! Admin menu was too short to reach 3rd level menu... Admin menu's sub element's width increased to 75% (was 51%)
(Developer note; it still requires some testing on real usage feedback is most welcome as always)
! Quick tasks doubleganker removed from 720p settings, it should flow freely now on... Long live the QuickTasks! (Hardlimited version of #quick_tasks removed from the responsive.css)
! In Core Features page, descriptions are hidden for overflow reasons but no more! Now you can freely read descriptions without scrolling in the area. Also its padding increased for possible overflowing with the icon
! We need space... So ? So... Don't go huge paddings where its not needed (padding on #adm_submenus removed to give more space)
! In admin section, all dt/dd elements got their 100% width to give better UX to users.
(Developer note; this can be bit problem but end result will give users on mobile at admin section huge UX benefits)
! (Cross Fingers) Annoying extra-background on main_menu item issue fixed... it shouldn't be showing the hidden background on them.
! Improvements on mlist (memberlist search)
! Added jQuery & SuperFish for menu to increase UX on mobile.
(Developer note; SuperFish might look small addition to system, it enabled click-to-open menu which greatly increases the mobile capibilities of the menu)
(Note2; This might lead to removing icons (requires official decision) and revert to old text-based)
[b]Version 1.0.0 - March 21 2016[/b]

! fix for main_menu weird background creation on tap/hover.
[b]Version 1.0 Beta 5 - June 11 2015[/b]
! Resolution range decreased to 720px (it was 780px)
! Resolution range decreased to 240px (it was 300px)
! Small margin changes on main_menu (dropmenu) for small devices (240px-640px)
! index_common_stats now hidden due to template styling (for small devices)
! Improvements for iPhone 4 (+earlier) users (now they can see menu if they can't before)
! Keyinfo now back but not fully, posts now showing time_stamp (as requested)
! A dirty fix added for Simple Portal (don't get your hopes up, can be removed before stable release)
! Problem with size on wrapper element fixed (fingers crossed :P)
